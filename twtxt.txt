1970-01-01T00:00:00+02:00	The beginning
2020-06-29T15:48:21+02:00	Hello World
2020-06-29T18:35:02+02:00	Not sure what I am doing here. Couldn't resist the simplicity I guess?
2020-06-30T05:03:30+02:00	This feels very much like talking into a void.
2020-06-30T05:03:48+02:00	Need to find some more people to follow
2020-06-30T12:51:50+02:00	I really like how simple the twtxt data format is
2020-06-30T12:53:27+02:00	My current twtxt posting setup is: post from emacs, cronjob that commits it into a git repo that gets published through netlify to hjertnes.social
2020-06-30T12:54:18+02:00	Currently use the twtxt cli program to read my timeline
2020-06-30T16:27:14+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> some activity :O
2020-06-30T19:13:22+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27 will support .config/emacs in addition to .emacs and .emacs.d :D
2020-06-30T19:19:07+02:00	Emacs 27 has a new elisp function: make-empty-file; will be awesome if your config needs a file to exist to work, like if you use a custom.el file or something
2020-06-30T19:23:27+02:00	Emacs 27 has offical support for JSX
2020-06-30T19:24:06+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Bar Mode: tabs for window / frame configurations
2020-06-30T19:24:19+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Line Mode: regular tabs for buffers
2020-06-30T19:29:39+02:00	Emacs 27 a new package for parsing ISO 8601 dates etc.
2020-06-30T19:32:52+02:00	Emacs 27 the news file for what is coming if you're interested https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27
2020-07-01T05:52:37+02:00	Good morning void
2020-07-01T18:23:31+02:00	LinkedIn is really weird
2020-07-01T18:36:22+02:00	This is so dumb. I bought three coloring books from a store, because then I would reach the point where I got free shipping. Except they had to order all three. And they are being sent as three seperate packages because they arrived at three different days.
2020-07-02T04:47:04+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> I've had that book my list of the longest. Usually a sign when I never buy something. 
2020-07-02T16:13:43+02:00	New pencils arrived today: https://blackwing602.com/products/blackwing-volume-42
2020-07-02T16:14:06+02:00	New bottle of ink arrived today: https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iroshizuku-Shin-kai-Ink-Deep-Sea-50-ml-Bottle/pd/9974
2020-07-02T16:29:19+02:00	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-on-facebook-ad-boycott-all-these-advertisers-will-be-back-soon-enough-2020-07-01 would be awesome if they didn't. 
2020-07-02T18:02:30+02:00	Bitbucket are deleting HG repos today. My first thought: is that still around? 
2020-07-03T05:04:18+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> Interesting. I never liked it. Git is terrible, but so am I. 
2020-07-03T20:43:18+02:00	I really like the blue color of the Iroshizuku Shin Kai ink :D
2020-07-03T20:43:38+02:00	After 5 days of using twtxt I got to say that it suits me really well. Mostly the fact that it is just a textfile
2020-07-04T11:57:05+02:00	Ea's name party is today; a non religious family gathering because I refuse to do anything religious like a baptism or the so called atheism versions of it
2020-07-04T23:15:28+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> isn't that like writing blog posts about blogging or CMS stuff?
2020-07-07T16:01:43+02:00	I really love how easy it is to remove downloaded music in Apple Music.
2020-07-08T07:47:49+02:00	The changes in the Slack UI is actually very nice; makes it easy to organize things if you have a lot of stuff going on there
2020-07-08T07:48:20+02:00	Interesting that the Facebook ad boycott continues
2020-07-09T15:57:08+02:00	I like this idea https://pragprog.com/titles/d-gobrain/
2020-07-10T08:52:57+02:00	Tom Hanks is on the latest episode of Hardcore History Addendum :o
2020-07-10T20:31:27+02:00	The new special github repos are interesting.
2020-07-11T10:38:13+02:00	Finally started to remove stuff from my blog(hjertnes.blog) and deleting stuff and making a plan to migrate the stuff I want to keep over to my wiki (hjertnes.wiki)
2020-07-13T14:12:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> If you create a repo with the same name as your username you'll see :D
2020-07-13T14:39:36+02:00	I know I should probably move to something else than GitHub because of all the ICE stuff. But I use netlify for a lot of stuff, and the only services they support are GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. And I don't feel like any of them are better.
2020-07-13T14:44:20+02:00	I'd move to https://sourcehut.org/ if I moved to anything
2020-07-13T14:45:33+02:00	I may still start moving stuff there, but I really don't like the idea of having stuff multiple places. And I love how well Netlify works 
2020-07-13T14:48:49+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> nope. Look here https://github.com/hjertnes/hjertnes and here: https://github.com/hjertnes
2020-07-13T14:49:38+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> if you add a repo with the same name as your username you can use it to add things to your profile page.
2020-07-13T16:09:22+02:00	So tired of the shit show that is also known as The United States of America 
2020-07-13T19:52:09+02:00	I like this client a lot https://github.com/quite/twet
2020-07-14T05:56:56+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Cool. I love how I can configure it only to show the new stuff since last time I showed the timeline.
2020-07-14T05:57:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I write all my posts in emacs and is very happy with that, but I'd love to hear more about your service :)
2020-07-14T05:58:21+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> The one thing I wish for twtxt was if there was a config file that contained all the non client specific stuff like following and url to twtxt etc
2020-07-14T06:53:12+02:00	Wait?! Is Drupal still a thing? 
2020-07-15T09:55:39+02:00	I really like the Dracula Pro theme: https://draculatheme.com/pro
2020-07-15T18:58:52+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> https://xkcd.com/927/
2020-07-17T05:49:31+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Replies is possible, but I agree that threads would be nice. But I don't see a good way to do it with a text file in a clean way
2020-07-17T20:12:00+02:00	Luna, our oldest dog left us yesterday. We gave her the best possible day we could give her, before going to the vet. We cried as she fell asleep from the first shot, and then I was alone while she left the world after the second shot. Petting her all the way to the end. I lost my best friend, and I feel horrible. 
2020-07-17T22:48:09+02:00	Yesterday was a really weird day for me. I said goodbye to Luna and in the middle of it I accepted a job offer. I'll be leaving Sbanken and joining Knowit in the start of November.
2020-07-17T22:52:40+02:00	Since GitHub continues to work with ICE I have decided to move all my stuff away from there. Probably to sourcehut. But I have some stuff that need to be on GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket like Netlify related stuff. Haven't decided what to do with it yet.
2020-07-18T08:07:22+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I have also seen people sort their twtxt files differently. I append, some prepend. If everyone appended it would work fine.
2020-07-18T08:08:00+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> Thank you.
2020-07-18T08:09:57+02:00	Starting to move away from GitHub - step 1: download and delete everything archived
2020-07-18T09:41:47+02:00	Started to move stuff from GitHub to here https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/
2020-07-18T11:38:56+02:00	About half of my stuff have been migrated. The stuff that requires github/gitlab/bitbucket will be pushed to both Sourcehut and GitLab
2020-07-18T16:29:57+02:00	For those who wonder, the reason I am moving away from GitHub is because they still continue to have ICE as a customer
2020-07-18T17:41:25+02:00	No offence to anyone writing any of them, but I feel like the web services for twtxt don't integrate well with those of us that prefer to have it as a text we can edit
2020-07-19T07:32:06+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> I would not go that far, but it isn't something that would work for me. I think they should exist though. It would be awesome if anyone managed to create a service that got more people to use twtxt :) 
2020-07-19T16:05:52+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I think it is always important to understand that stuff isn't "wrong" just because it isn't for me :) 
2020-07-20T07:24:01+02:00	When I see a "mistakes junior devs make" I always want to write a "opinions senior devs have because it made sense at some point"
2020-07-20T19:17:49+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Multiple twtxt feeds on the same handle sounds like a mess. A unrealted comment: I wish it was easier to discover mentions... 
2020-07-20T20:28:50+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> Thanks. I could, but then I had to change to a different hosting solution. 
2020-07-21T08:14:39+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> (re post length) I don't even try to follow it. Probably becausse I never use any of the clients and write everything in emacs.
2020-07-21T17:43:11+02:00	Let's check if the cronjobs on my new hosting works
2020-07-21T20:29:08+02:00	Using Caddy as a web server was a fantastic experience; the only thing I didn't enjoy is that v2 isn't in Arch Linux yet.
2020-07-22T10:05:41+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> I downloaded a snapshot of a AUR package. I have been using nginx for the last 10 years or so. I really liked how little config was required to host some static files with https through lets encrypt
2020-07-22T10:17:44+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> s/vim/emacs/g
2020-07-22T18:32:05+02:00	Just took a look at firn(https://firn.theiceshelf.com/getting-started), interesting but if you want to build a website from a org file in a more complex way than pandoc allows(like I do here https://hjertnes.wiki and https://home.hjertnes.blog) I think ox-hugo works better because it just exports to hugo and let it do all the cms stuff
2020-07-22T18:41:58+02:00	People were talking about ZSH earlier; used to use it. I have been using fish as my go to shell for over two years now.
2020-07-22T20:18:21+02:00	I always forget about this: ssh user@host command, and really love it and use it all the time when I'm reminded. For when you would have ssh user@host typed some command and exited
2020-07-22T20:59:57+02:00	I think there is a lot of issues with the 30% cut Apple charge from AppStores developers in 2020. I thought it made some sense 12 years ago. At this point I think Apple should reduce it to a point where they more or less break even on it. And start charging extra for services that improve developers life. That would give them much better incentives for imroving things than the current model.
2020-07-23T07:50:12+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Do you also include User-Agent with followers when you fetch feeds?
2020-07-24T16:23:13+02:00	Posted something to my blog: https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-07-24-wiki/
2020-07-24T16:23:10+02:00	Posted something to my blog: https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-07-24-likes/
2020-07-24T16:23:50+02:00	(re-posted since you didn't answer 😜) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Do you also include User-Agent with followers when you fetch feeds?
2020-07-24T17:10:15+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> What if you include a url in the header where one could see the followers of your feed?
2020-07-24T20:40:52+02:00	I'd love all twtxt client developers to adopt a shared config for all the stuff that is the same on all clients like this one: https://hjertnes.social/config.yaml And then place all the client specific stuff in a different file 
2020-07-25T08:01:15+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> (re include URL of followers) followers and mentions are not the same though. 
2020-07-25T08:03:17+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> ((re std config for twtxt clients) I'd prefer them all to use one config so you don't have to maintain multiple lists of followers between different clients..
