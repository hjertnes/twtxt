1970-01-01T00:00:00+02:00	The beginning
2020-06-29T15:48:21+02:00	Hello World
2020-06-29T18:35:02+02:00	Not sure what I am doing here. Couldn't resist the simplicity I guess?
2020-06-30T05:03:30+02:00	This feels very much like talking into a void.
2020-06-30T05:03:48+02:00	Need to find some more people to follow
2020-06-30T12:51:50+02:00	I really like how simple the twtxt data format is
2020-06-30T12:53:27+02:00	My current twtxt posting setup is: post from emacs, cronjob that commits it into a git repo that gets published through netlify to hjertnes.social
2020-06-30T12:54:18+02:00	Currently use the twtxt cli program to read my timeline
2020-06-30T16:27:14+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> some activity :O
2020-06-30T19:13:22+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27 will support .config/emacs in addition to .emacs and .emacs.d :D
2020-06-30T19:19:07+02:00	Emacs 27 has a new elisp function: make-empty-file; will be awesome if your config needs a file to exist to work, like if you use a custom.el file or something
2020-06-30T19:23:27+02:00	Emacs 27 has offical support for JSX
2020-06-30T19:24:06+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Bar Mode: tabs for window / frame configurations
2020-06-30T19:24:19+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Line Mode: regular tabs for buffers
2020-06-30T19:29:39+02:00	Emacs 27 a new package for parsing ISO 8601 dates etc.
2020-06-30T19:32:52+02:00	Emacs 27 the news file for what is coming if you're interested https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27
2020-07-01T05:52:37+02:00	Good morning void
2020-07-01T18:23:31+02:00	LinkedIn is really weird
2020-07-01T18:36:22+02:00	This is so dumb. I bought three coloring books from a store, because then I would reach the point where I got free shipping. Except they had to order all three. And they are being sent as three seperate packages because they arrived at three different days.
2020-07-02T04:47:04+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> I've had that book my list of the longest. Usually a sign when I never buy something. 
2020-07-02T16:13:43+02:00	New pencils arrived today: https://blackwing602.com/products/blackwing-volume-42
2020-07-02T16:14:06+02:00	New bottle of ink arrived today: https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iroshizuku-Shin-kai-Ink-Deep-Sea-50-ml-Bottle/pd/9974
2020-07-02T16:29:19+02:00	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-on-facebook-ad-boycott-all-these-advertisers-will-be-back-soon-enough-2020-07-01 would be awesome if they didn't. 
2020-07-02T18:02:30+02:00	Bitbucket are deleting HG repos today. My first thought: is that still around? 
2020-07-03T05:04:18+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> Interesting. I never liked it. Git is terrible, but so am I. 
2020-07-03T20:43:18+02:00	I really like the blue color of the Iroshizuku Shin Kai ink :D
2020-07-03T20:43:38+02:00	After 5 days of using twtxt I got to say that it suits me really well. Mostly the fact that it is just a textfile
2020-07-04T11:57:05+02:00	Ea's name party is today; a non religious family gathering because I refuse to do anything religious like a baptism or the so called atheism versions of it
2020-07-04T23:15:28+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> isn't that like writing blog posts about blogging or CMS stuff?
2020-07-07T16:01:43+02:00	I really love how easy it is to remove downloaded music in Apple Music.
2020-07-08T07:47:49+02:00	The changes in the Slack UI is actually very nice; makes it easy to organize things if you have a lot of stuff going on there
2020-07-08T07:48:20+02:00	Interesting that the Facebook ad boycott continues
2020-07-09T15:57:08+02:00	I like this idea https://pragprog.com/titles/d-gobrain/
2020-07-10T08:52:57+02:00	Tom Hanks is on the latest episode of Hardcore History Addendum :o
2020-07-10T20:31:27+02:00	The new special github repos are interesting.
2020-07-11T10:38:13+02:00	Finally started to remove stuff from my blog(hjertnes.blog) and deleting stuff and making a plan to migrate the stuff I want to keep over to my wiki (hjertnes.wiki)
2020-07-13T14:12:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> If you create a repo with the same name as your username you'll see :D
2020-07-13T14:39:36+02:00	I know I should probably move to something else than GitHub because of all the ICE stuff. But I use netlify for a lot of stuff, and the only services they support are GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. And I don't feel like any of them are better.
2020-07-13T14:44:20+02:00	I'd move to https://sourcehut.org/ if I moved to anything
2020-07-13T14:45:33+02:00	I may still start moving stuff there, but I really don't like the idea of having stuff multiple places. And I love how well Netlify works 
2020-07-13T14:48:49+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> nope. Look here https://github.com/hjertnes/hjertnes and here: https://github.com/hjertnes
2020-07-13T14:49:38+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> if you add a repo with the same name as your username you can use it to add things to your profile page.
2020-07-13T16:09:22+02:00	So tired of the shit show that is also known as The United States of America 
2020-07-13T19:52:09+02:00	I like this client a lot https://github.com/quite/twet
2020-07-14T05:56:56+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Cool. I love how I can configure it only to show the new stuff since last time I showed the timeline.
2020-07-14T05:57:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I write all my posts in emacs and is very happy with that, but I'd love to hear more about your service :)
2020-07-14T05:58:21+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> The one thing I wish for twtxt was if there was a config file that contained all the non client specific stuff like following and url to twtxt etc
2020-07-14T06:53:12+02:00	Wait?! Is Drupal still a thing? 
2020-07-15T09:55:39+02:00	I really like the Dracula Pro theme: https://draculatheme.com/pro
2020-07-15T18:58:52+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> https://xkcd.com/927/
2020-07-17T05:49:31+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Replies is possible, but I agree that threads would be nice. But I don't see a good way to do it with a text file in a clean way
2020-07-17T20:12:00+02:00	Luna, our oldest dog left us yesterday. We gave her the best possible day we could give her, before going to the vet. We cried as she fell asleep from the first shot, and then I was alone while she left the world after the second shot. Petting her all the way to the end. I lost my best friend, and I feel horrible. 
2020-07-17T22:48:09+02:00	Yesterday was a really weird day for me. I said goodbye to Luna and in the middle of it I accepted a job offer. I'll be leaving Sbanken and joining Knowit in the start of November.
2020-07-17T22:52:40+02:00	Since GitHub continues to work with ICE I have decided to move all my stuff away from there. Probably to sourcehut. But I have some stuff that need to be on GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket like Netlify related stuff. Haven't decided what to do with it yet.
2020-07-18T08:07:22+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I have also seen people sort their twtxt files differently. I append, some prepend. If everyone appended it would work fine.
2020-07-18T08:08:00+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> Thank you.
2020-07-18T08:09:57+02:00	Starting to move away from GitHub - step 1: download and delete everything archived
2020-07-18T09:41:47+02:00	Started to move stuff from GitHub to here https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/
2020-07-18T11:38:56+02:00	About half of my stuff have been migrated. The stuff that requires github/gitlab/bitbucket will be pushed to both Sourcehut and GitLab
2020-07-18T16:29:57+02:00	For those who wonder, the reason I am moving away from GitHub is because they still continue to have ICE as a customer
2020-07-18T17:41:25+02:00	No offence to anyone writing any of them, but I feel like the web services for twtxt don't integrate well with those of us that prefer to have it as a text we can edit
2020-07-19T07:32:06+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> I would not go that far, but it isn't something that would work for me. I think they should exist though. It would be awesome if anyone managed to create a service that got more people to use twtxt :) 
2020-07-19T16:05:52+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I think it is always important to understand that stuff isn't "wrong" just because it isn't for me :) 
2020-07-20T07:24:01+02:00	When I see a "mistakes junior devs make" I always want to write a "opinions senior devs have because it made sense at some point"
2020-07-20T19:17:49+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Multiple twtxt feeds on the same handle sounds like a mess. A unrealted comment: I wish it was easier to discover mentions... 
2020-07-20T20:28:50+02:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> Thanks. I could, but then I had to change to a different hosting solution. 
2020-07-21T08:14:39+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> (re post length) I don't even try to follow it. Probably becausse I never use any of the clients and write everything in emacs.
2020-07-21T17:43:11+02:00	Let's check if the cronjobs on my new hosting works
2020-07-21T20:29:08+02:00	Using Caddy as a web server was a fantastic experience; the only thing I didn't enjoy is that v2 isn't in Arch Linux yet.
2020-07-22T10:05:41+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> I downloaded a snapshot of a AUR package. I have been using nginx for the last 10 years or so. I really liked how little config was required to host some static files with https through lets encrypt
2020-07-22T10:17:44+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> s/vim/emacs/g
2020-07-22T18:32:05+02:00	Just took a look at firn(https://firn.theiceshelf.com/getting-started), interesting but if you want to build a website from a org file in a more complex way than pandoc allows(like I do here https://hjertnes.wiki and https://home.hjertnes.blog) I think ox-hugo works better because it just exports to hugo and let it do all the cms stuff
2020-07-22T18:41:58+02:00	People were talking about ZSH earlier; used to use it. I have been using fish as my go to shell for over two years now.
2020-07-22T20:18:21+02:00	I always forget about this: ssh user@<<host, >, > command, and really love it and use it all the time when I'm reminded. For when you would have ssh user@<<host, >, > typed some command and exited
2020-07-22T20:59:57+02:00	I think there is a lot of issues with the 30% cut Apple charge from AppStores developers in 2020. I thought it made some sense 12 years ago. At this point I think Apple should reduce it to a point where they more or less break even on it. And start charging extra for services that improve developers life. That would give them much better incentives for imroving things than the current model.
2020-07-23T07:50:12+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Do you also include User-Agent with followers when you fetch feeds?
2020-07-24T16:23:13+02:00	Posted something to my blog: https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-07-24-wiki/
2020-07-24T16:23:10+02:00	Posted something to my blog: https://hjertnes.blog/posts/2020-07-24-likes/
2020-07-24T16:23:50+02:00	(re-posted since you didn't answer 😜) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Do you also include User-Agent with followers when you fetch feeds?
2020-07-24T17:10:15+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> What if you include a url in the header where one could see the followers of your feed?
2020-07-24T20:40:52+02:00	I'd love all twtxt client developers to adopt a shared config for all the stuff that is the same on all clients like this one: https://hjertnes.social/config.yaml And then place all the client specific stuff in a different file 
2020-07-25T08:01:15+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> (re include URL of followers) followers and mentions are not the same though. 
2020-07-25T08:03:17+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> ((re std config for twtxt clients) I'd prefer them all to use one config so you don't have to maintain multiple lists of followers between different clients..
2020-07-25T11:47:40+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> My point is that: when a user fetches my feed with for example twtxt or twet and they have it enabled I can see who they are in my web server logs. Great for discovery and such. But I assume you only fetch feeds globally and not once per user? Not that important. If I see a fetch from twtxt.net in my web server logs I'd love to have a way to see who follows me there. 
2020-07-25T11:48:47+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Where should I file the issue?
2020-07-25T12:31:06+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> issues created :)
2020-07-25T13:20:47+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> I have some fetches from it. But I don't see them because I strip out various stuff in my parser program (https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/caddyLogParser/tree/master/main.go). Basically various bots plus anything not containing http or https.
2020-07-25T16:01:45+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> (re-polling interval) You could probably do a HEAD request prior to the GET, and check if the Content-Length header have changed.
2020-07-25T16:22:56+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Are you trying to get me to contribute to stuff I don't use? 😅
2020-07-25T16:25:48+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> And I think most web servers like caddy and nginx does HEAD correctly out of the box for static files
2020-07-25T20:09:41+02:00	Why is it twtxt and not tw.txt 🤔
2020-07-25T20:11:28+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Where do you see twtxt.net fit in for us stubborn command line and text editor assholes? 😅
2020-07-25T22:00:11+02:00	Just set [[https://forget.codl.fr/][this]] up for my [[https://dog.estate/@hjertnes][mastodon]]
2020-07-25T22:00:26+02:00	Yeah, I use org-mode formatting instead of markdown
2020-07-26T08:00:19+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> (re tw.txt) no, but I meant the file name. Most people have something like twtxt.txt; just wonder why it isn't tw.txt
2020-07-26T10:23:43+02:00	Testing something
2020-07-26T11:47:53+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> just a script to post the last line of my twtxt to mastodon
2020-07-26T12:25:12+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> It's not that hard to run a Mastodon instance. But there are some moving pieces. I use [[https://masto.host]] to host my Instance. I don't need it, but I wanted a script to run when I have written something in this file, that I also want to post there. Saves me a few seconds compared to copy pasting it somewhere. 
2020-07-26T13:41:40+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> writing dumb scripts like this [[https://paste.sr.ht/~hjertnes/daa656a0f6a1cc1901fac88f3bcedefee79e8d3c]] is why I love when stuff is just a file on my laptop.
2020-07-26T14:20:22+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> Would that API also let you replace the twtxt file on your server?T
2020-07-26T16:03:02+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> That I can download the file, alter it as I want and replace that file with the one on your server.
2020-07-27T19:26:10+02:00	Kind of made a twtxt client https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/tw.txt 🙈
2020-07-27T20:02:54+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> 👋
2020-07-27T20:09:06+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> 🤓
2020-07-28T06:42:42+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/u/prologic> (re tw.txt) I know, never said I'd implement them 🙈. But I have implemented a version of our "common config file" idea 
2020-07-28T15:30:42+02:00	Added a bunch of stuff to [[https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/tw.txt][twtxt]]: follow, unfollow, tweet, more edit functions to cover both the config files. And replace mentions if you want to replace@<sdk https://codevoid.de/tw.txt>with @<handle url> for example after writing in the file using your text editor
2020-07-28T16:42:29+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> doesn't everyone use the RFC3339 timestamps?
2020-07-28T18:33:22+02:00	default git branch changed to trunk
2020-07-28T21:04:30+02:00	Instead of trying to find photo web services I enjoy, I'm just going to make albums in Photos.app on my Mac
2020-07-29T14:43:38+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> thanks! felt kind of dumb making another twtxt client; but I don't regret it
2020-07-29T16:21:44+02:00	Does it make sense to offload lines in a twtxt file to a archive file at some point?
2020-07-29T16:54:39+02:00	I'm not that worried about ML/AI turning into Terminators before I can tell Photos.app: Make a album of all the pictures of <insert dog name here>.
2020-07-29T18:48:30+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> https://media.giphy.com/media/TlK63Euc9KArc2a0kEw/giphy.gif
2020-07-30T07:53:03+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re archive) maybe we should have a convention for the name of this that doesn't require backend software?
2020-07-30T09:19:33+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re archive) or maybe some discovery config file?
2020-07-30T11:51:36+02:00	time to write some unit tests for tw.txt 🥳
2020-07-30T12:09:59+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-archive) to add a pagination thing that makes sense is easy for you running it behind a proper backend, but a lot of us prefer just having files behind some web server, and then it isn't trivial. I like the year idea. Or just having a huge ass twtxt-archive.txt file
2020-07-30T17:09:55+02:00	Pushed v0.5.0 of tw.txt. Not a lot new, but I have the features I want and I have written tests and fixed all the linting errors 🤷‍♂️
2020-07-30T17:46:14+02:00	GoLand 2020.2 is out! https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2020/07/30/introducing-goland-2020-2/
2020-07-30T19:46:52+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27 RC1 is out!
2020-07-30T20:15:04+02:00	My plans on doing a "100th line in my twtxt" didn't work out, as this is line 121 *facepalm*
2020-07-30T20:19:58+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27.1 will be released in a week http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/HISTORY?h=emacs-27&id=27877e7bcfa37b2c97a3dde170f870d4729ff807

2020-07-31T07:08:27+02:00	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> I'm not American
2020-07-31T10:20:40+02:00@<golang_news https://feeds.twtxt.net/golang_news/twtxt.txt>(re-not american) All nationalities should be welcome. But I think it is important to keep in mind that people most likely have different experiences, opertunities and life than you have
2020-07-31T10:23:33+02:00	@<kt84 https://twtxt.net/user/kt84/twtxt.txt> (re-voting) it is very common with low voter participation hre too. Here they are trying to make it as easy as possible to vote to improve it. For example that you can walk in any pre-vote location for like a month before election day. Instead of the current trend of trying to keep people from voting in the US.
2020-07-31T16:52:42+02:00	What fonts are everyone using in their text editors and terminals these days?
2020-07-31T17:48:53+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm still on Jetbrains Mono
2020-07-31T19:42:21+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> what lisp?

2020-08-01T20:08:12+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> 🤷‍♀️
2020-08-01T20:09:04+02:00	Been working on a html timeline export for tw.txt today. Not sure why.
2020-08-01T22:48:09+02:00	I really enjoy having made this HTML version of my timeline in twtxt [[https://hjertnes.social/timeline.html]]
2020-08-01T22:52:00+02:00	@<mox https://tilde.town/~mox/twtxt.txt> I have been bothering @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> with some complicating suggestions to make [[twtxt.net]] usable for those of us that like to have our twtxt.txt file as a file
2020-08-02T07:02:53+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> isn't blank here 🤔
2020-08-02T07:23:13+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-avatar) not sure what it is, but sure?
2020-08-02T08:24:11+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-avatar) okay. How do I do that?
2020-08-02T18:37:05+02:00	Re-watched The Dirt. Loved it this time too.
2020-08-02T20:55:29+02:00	Unpopular opinion I really hate regex, so I started to tinker with this https://git.sr.ht/~hjertnes/patterns
2020-08-02T21:27:59+02:00	I love the simplicity of go package management
2020-08-03T07:39:23+02:00	(re-regex) @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't know, I hate them at the point where I don't use them unless people force me too in code review at work. I think most people either love them or accept them
2020-08-03T07:42:19+02:00	(re-wiki) @<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> details?
2020-08-03T08:48:46+02:00	(re-wiki) @<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> still using org?
2020-08-03T09:24:41+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm lost
2020-08-03T10:12:24+02:00	Unfollwoed a bunch of people on the same domain because of a giant rant of duplicated posts on every single feed about some clients not caching properly. Unrelated note, I'm working on caching tw.txt
2020-08-03T18:38:57+02:00	Seems like I have a working cache
2020-08-03T18:40:34+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Not you :) I'd reach out to you in a non public way to resolve it in a nice way if I had any problems with anything :)
2020-08-03T20:33:14+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> SQL <3
2020-08-03T21:08:37+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> (re-sql) SQL makes a lot more sense, than a lot of software stuff, if you use a good SQL engine and have a well designed database and are willing to spend some time getting it right. Or just use a GOOD ORM.
2020-08-03T21:13:41+02:00	Yay! I found a Norwegian web shot where I can order dried chilli
2020-08-03T21:16:09+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> not sure what hurting a horse has to do with SQL...
2020-08-04T10:47:13+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what exactly do you mean by federation for twtxt.net?
2020-08-04T10:52:41+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think it would be a good fit for the txt file mindset of twtxt to adopt something like ActivityPub.
2020-08-04T10:53:33+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My first thought would have been to maintain the needed data in our config.yaml, and expose everything needed in there. 
2020-08-05T08:05:26+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtssxt.txt> @<lukem https://twtxt.net/user/lukem/twtxt.txt> Netlify is awesome, I used to use it for all of my stuff until recently
2020-08-05T09:00:33+02:00	No idea why, but I always really enjoy writing unit tests and fixing / refactoring things as a part of that. 
2020-08-05T09:52:25+02:00	@<lucidiot https://tilde.town/~lucidiot/twtxt.txt> that's not *that* bad, and it is not uncommon to see the HTTP side of things become like that when you use automagic abstractions in stuff like .NET Framework
2020-08-05T10:52:35+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-unit testing) I would, if I used it. If I were you, I would instead make implementing unit test and fixing linting on the parts that have been touched in a PR requirement for approval
2020-08-05T20:27:54+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> k8 seems to be the go to way these days, if you need a cluster. I still think just regular docker-compose is a good strategy if you just have one or a few hosts
2020-08-05T20:43:27+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-microblogging length) I don't think there should be a hard limit, but I do think it is a good idea to not encourage too long posts. I'm much more likely to read stuff that isn't too long
2020-08-05T20:51:54+02:00	Emacs 27 RC2 is out!
2020-08-06T11:04:38+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Twitter are free to to what the hell they want with their own service. Freedom of speach and freedom of press doens't give you the right to publish anything anywhere. I personally think twitter and platforms like it should monitor content published to them much more than they do, because of how many people have them as their only source of news and facts. The spread of hate and bad informations (especially medical) can be extremly damaging and are the source of a lot of our current problems
2020-08-06T11:08:17+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Rx and React are similar but not the same thing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_extensions . React is not that complicated, it may be if you compare it to rendering static pages from a backend, but that's not really a fair comparison and two completly different apporaches to different use cases
2020-08-06T13:28:56+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can be both a back end and front end dev; I really hate the term full stack, because it usually means a developer that mostly does one of them and are terrible at the other. One thing I think is really important to keep in mind when we talk about tools in general (and a library or framework is a tool) is if you understand the problems a tool are solving and if it is the right one for this job
2020-08-06T14:20:51+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (right tools for the job) I care more about writing clean code that follow SOLID principles, than not using frameworks. The important thing in my head is that you understand what a library framework does
2020-08-06T14:21:53+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (and I prefer using Echo or some other router library to the one in the standard library 🙈
2020-08-06T16:47:26+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  yeah. I got a list of the people @<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> followed when I started with Masto. And I guess I would have stuggeled a lot without that. In the same way I had a hard time with twtxt until I found we-are-twtxt.
2020-08-06T17:42:44+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> the trick is to show them on their instance. Because it will only federate their posts from the point the first person on a instance followed someone
2020-08-06T19:32:35+02:00	@<felix https://felix.plesoianu.ro/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> or know someone on mastodon that you can get some follow suggestions from
2020-08-06T19:33:19+02:00	Time to get back to my actual hobby project: my bookmarking service. Because I really really want to get it done enough so I can use it myself.
2020-08-06T19:35:45+02:00	NuMetal is NotMetal
2020-08-07T11:47:16+02:00	@<mdosch https://mdosch.de/twtxt.txt> Haven't been listening to metal in years, but at this point metal metal is probably a thing 😂
2020-08-08T08:00:29+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> are you really fixing bugs on IE? It is so old and have so little use that we don't even support it at work
2020-08-08T08:42:44+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I can also edit my twtxt; because it is a file on my computer 😏
2020-08-08T10:43:54+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> re IE) It's your project :) I just know that would not have been something I'd support 😅
2020-08-08T12:50:33+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re IE) I do agree with that. But I also think that it is perfectly fine to chose what you want to support.
2020-08-08T13:35:00+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re IE) There are a lot of things you can't do, if you want to support legacy browsers. I for one prefer both the user experience and the developer experience of making JavaScript based Web Apps over Web Apps that is mostly just rendered server side. When I do projects on my spare time, I try to remove all the stuff I don't think is a lot of fun to deal with, because then it is much more likely that I prioritize it.
2020-08-08T20:34:37+02:00	Dammit @<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> for getting me to think about re-doing my wiki
2020-08-09T09:09:50+02:00	Just did some cleanup in the feeds I follow. Decided to get rid of a lot of feeds that didn't look like they were active
2020-08-09T09:13:34+02:00	Getting close to be done with the changes I started doing to how I build my wiki yesterday
2020-08-09T10:46:29+02:00	Changes to https://hjertnes/wiki is done. The short version is that I have moved it back to using ox-hugo and hugo instead of just a giant HTML file generated with pandoc. Still working to bring back some of the stuff I really liked about the giant HTML file
2020-08-09T12:55:26+02:00	Sun outside today. Always mixed feelings about that. On one side it is nice weather, but that also means I have to cut the grass in my garden
2020-08-09T14:02:51+02:00	Hmm, interesting how old all operating systems are
2020-08-09T15:31:32+02:00	@<freemor https://freemor.homelinux.net/~freemor/twtxt.txt> Not going to do that 😅
2020-08-10T08:15:45+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-garden) Where is the 🦘 and 🐊 and 🐨??!
2020-08-10T08:19:55+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re-garden) Where is the 🦘 and 🐊 and 🐨??!
2020-08-10T09:18:16+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hahaha. Only thing missing there would have been some AC/DC reference and a Crocodile Dundee joke 😅
2020-08-10T09:22:55+02:00	Back to Terminal.app because there is some weird issue with iTerm2 and fish on my machine
2020-08-10T09:29:05+02:00	One more week of vacation before I'm going back to work
2020-08-10T09:43:36+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe. I just made my own thing mostly from scratch because I realized that it would be a lot of work to rewrite @<twet > to be like I wanted it to be. What is the purpose of twt?
2020-08-10T15:42:30+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Like everything else related to twtxt.net it is partly me not using it, and partly because I don't have enough time to do everything
2020-08-10T15:42:45+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> emacs is awesome
2020-08-10T15:42:49+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> org is awesome
2020-08-10T15:48:05+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> how long is it?
2020-08-10T18:01:38+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> the og terminal is fine, but I do miss being able to hit Control twice to get a temrinal over everything else
2020-08-10T18:04:22+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> the bug is only there some times, and with the magic of tmux I can use both
2020-08-10T19:34:03+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> I think Figma is awesome, probably overkill for wireframing, but it is awesome for working with implementing full interactive designs at work. How about Adobe xd?
2020-08-10T21:18:47+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> Haha. Whispers: should you really be that obvious about being Jewish in Trump America?
2020-08-10T21:20:33+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> You could try this: https://wireflow.co/
2020-08-10T23:14:21+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> time to invest in a red hat?
2020-08-11T09:36:28+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (re the 2009 thing) Money complicates everything
2020-08-11T10:14:19+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (decentral twitter) it can be done, and the hard part is not technical. The hard problem is to get enough people to use it and being able to make money in a non horrible way that is sustainable
2020-08-11T10:15:00+02:00	Emacs 27.1 is out!
2020-08-11T11:07:37+02:00	@<melyanna https://tilde.club/~melyanna/twtxt.txt> 👋
2020-08-11T18:13:04+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (Resumes and buzz words and all of that) there are some reasons for it being like that, the main one is that most employers want people who make sure they stay up to date and when they also use HR for recruitment it gets like this
2020-08-11T18:47:27+02:00	I wish people tried to understand why things are like that, before complaining
2020-08-11T19:54:56+02:00	@<eli_oat https://txt.eli.li/twtxt/twtxt.txt> whispers: you could just steal my ox-hugo and hugo setup?
2020-08-12T07:22:02+02:00	@<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> (tiktok tracking) Users are tracked for a number of different reasons. One of them is that the data itself is something that can be sold directly or indirectly, like Facebook or Google's ad platform does. Some of the tracking is needed to give advertisers the data they want. And sometimes it is used to discover problems in your UI or to test changes to your UI. It is easy to say 'why do we need this?'. But the reality is very different when you start a company, with employees and investors .
