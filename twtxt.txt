2020-06-29T15:48:21+02:00	Hello World
2020-06-29T18:35:02+02:00	Not sure what I am doing here. Couldn't resist the simplicity I guess?
2020-06-30T05:03:30+02:00	This feels very much like talking into a void.
2020-06-30T05:03:48+02:00	Need to find some more people to follow
2020-06-30T12:51:50+02:00	I really like how simple the twtxt data format is
2020-06-30T12:53:27+02:00	My current twtxt posting setup is: post from emacs, cronjob that commits it into a git repo that gets published through netlify to hjertnes.social
2020-06-30T12:54:18+02:00	Currently use the twtxt cli program to read my timeline
2020-06-30T16:27:14+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> some activity :O
2020-06-30T19:13:22+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27 will support .config/emacs in addition to .emacs and .emacs.d :D
