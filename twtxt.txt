1970-01-01T00:00:00+02:00	The beginning
2020-06-29T15:48:21+02:00	Hello World
2020-06-29T18:35:02+02:00	Not sure what I am doing here. Couldn't resist the simplicity I guess?
2020-06-30T05:03:30+02:00	This feels very much like talking into a void.
2020-06-30T05:03:48+02:00	Need to find some more people to follow
2020-06-30T12:51:50+02:00	I really like how simple the twtxt data format is
2020-06-30T12:53:27+02:00	My current twtxt posting setup is: post from emacs, cronjob that commits it into a git repo that gets published through netlify to hjertnes.social
2020-06-30T12:54:18+02:00	Currently use the twtxt cli program to read my timeline
2020-06-30T16:27:14+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> some activity :O
2020-06-30T19:13:22+02:00	Seems like Emacs 27 will support .config/emacs in addition to .emacs and .emacs.d :D
2020-06-30T19:19:07+02:00	Emacs 27 has a new elisp function: make-empty-file; will be awesome if your config needs a file to exist to work, like if you use a custom.el file or something
2020-06-30T19:23:27+02:00	Emacs 27 has offical support for JSX
2020-06-30T19:24:06+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Bar Mode: tabs for window / frame configurations
2020-06-30T19:24:19+02:00	Emacs 27 Tab Line Mode: regular tabs for buffers
2020-06-30T19:29:39+02:00	Emacs 27 a new package for parsing ISO 8601 dates etc.
2020-06-30T19:32:52+02:00	Emacs 27 the news file for what is coming if you're interested https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS.27
2020-07-01T05:52:37+02:00	Good morning void
2020-07-01T18:23:31+02:00	LinkedIn is really weird
2020-07-01T18:36:22+02:00	This is so dumb. I bought three coloring books from a store, because then I would reach the point where I got free shipping. Except they had to order all three. And they are being sent as three seperate packages because they arrived at three different days.
2020-07-02T04:47:04+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> I've had that book my list of the longest. Usually a sign when I never buy something. 
2020-07-02T16:13:43+02:00	New pencils arrived today: https://blackwing602.com/products/blackwing-volume-42
2020-07-02T16:14:06+02:00	New bottle of ink arrived today: https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Iroshizuku-Shin-kai-Ink-Deep-Sea-50-ml-Bottle/pd/9974
2020-07-02T16:29:19+02:00	https://www.marketwatch.com/story/zuckerberg-on-facebook-ad-boycott-all-these-advertisers-will-be-back-soon-enough-2020-07-01 would be awesome if they didn't. 
2020-07-02T18:02:30+02:00	Bitbucket are deleting HG repos today. My first thought: is that still around? 
2020-07-03T05:04:18+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> Interesting. I never liked it. Git is terrible, but so am I. 
2020-07-03T20:43:18+02:00	I really like the blue color of the Iroshizuku Shin Kai ink :D
2020-07-03T20:43:38+02:00	After 5 days of using twtxt I got to say that it suits me really well. Mostly the fact that it is just a textfile
2020-07-04T11:57:05+02:00	Ea's name party is today; a non religious family gathering because I refuse to do anything religious like a baptism or the so called atheism versions of it
2020-07-04T23:15:28+02:00	@<jack http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt> isn't that like writing blog posts about blogging or CMS stuff?
2020-07-07T16:01:43+02:00	I really love how easy it is to remove downloaded music in Apple Music.
2020-07-08T07:47:49+02:00	The changes in the Slack UI is actually very nice; makes it easy to organize things if you have a lot of stuff going on there
2020-07-08T07:48:20+02:00	Interesting that the Facebook ad boycott continues
2020-07-09T15:57:08+02:00	I like this idea https://pragprog.com/titles/d-gobrain/
2020-07-10T08:52:57+02:00	Tom Hanks is on the latest episode of Hardcore History Addendum :o
2020-07-10T20:31:27+02:00	The new special github repos are interesting.
2020-07-11T10:38:13+02:00	Finally started to remove stuff from my blog(hjertnes.blog) and deleting stuff and making a plan to migrate the stuff I want to keep over to my wiki (hjertnes.wiki)
2020-07-13T14:12:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> If you create a repo with the same name as your username you'll see :D
2020-07-13T14:39:36+02:00	I know I should probably move to something else than GitHub because of all the ICE stuff. But I use netlify for a lot of stuff, and the only services they support are GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. And I don't feel like any of them are better.
2020-07-13T14:44:20+02:00	I'd move to https://sourcehut.org/ if I moved to anything
2020-07-13T14:45:33+02:00	I may still start moving stuff there, but I really don't like the idea of having stuff multiple places. And I love how well Netlify works 
2020-07-13T14:48:49+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> nope. Look here https://github.com/hjertnes/hjertnes and here: https://github.com/hjertnes
2020-07-13T14:49:38+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> if you add a repo with the same name as your username you can use it to add things to your profile page.
2020-07-13T16:09:22+02:00	So tired of the shit show that is also known as The United States of America 
2020-07-13T19:52:09+02:00	I like this client a lot https://github.com/quite/twet
2020-07-14T05:56:56+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Cool. I love how I can configure it only to show the new stuff since last time I showed the timeline.
2020-07-14T05:57:40+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> I write all my posts in emacs and is very happy with that, but I'd love to hear more about your service :)
2020-07-14T05:58:21+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> The one thing I wish for twtxt was if there was a config file that contained all the non client specific stuff like following and url to twtxt etc
2020-07-14T06:53:12+02:00	Wait?! Is Drupal still a thing? 
2020-07-15T09:55:39+02:00	I really like the Dracula Pro theme: https://draculatheme.com/pro
2020-07-15T18:58:52+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> https://xkcd.com/927/
2020-07-17T05:49:31+02:00	@<prologic https://prologic.github.io/twtxt.txt> Replies is possible, but I agree that threads would be nice. But I don't see a good way to do it with a text file in a clean way
Luna, our oldest dog left us yesterday. We gave her the best possible day we could give her, before going to the vet. We cried as she fell asleep from the first shot, and then I was alone while she left the world after the second shot. Petting her all the way to the end. I lost my best friend, and I feel horrible.
